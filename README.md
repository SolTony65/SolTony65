- 👨 I'm a middle-aged guy from Sweden, living in Spain for over 20 years.
- People describe me as a good person and say I have a heart bigger than my head.
- Interpreter in several languages, mostly in health care and public institutions (except Notary, Court cases).
- Trying to help people with different daily tasks when there are language barriers.
- Lived a hard life with a lot of bullying, humility and no childhood. That has given me extended knowledge about things, works and people.
